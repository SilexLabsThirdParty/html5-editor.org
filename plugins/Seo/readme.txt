********************
**  Description   **
********************

This plugin adds the possiblity to generate SEO (Search Engine Optimization) informations for a silex site in some specific cases.
Normal cases are already taken care of by Silex.

It is specifically designed for these cases:
-when different pages (or deeplinks) share the same layer (useful for multiple languages contexts).
-when dynamic content is used. In that case the seo plugin should be run regularly.

This includes:
 -accessors resolving
 -Oof selector children resolving and parsing

Silex natively takes care of the following cases, when you are saving the layers via the Wysiwyg:
-only one deeplink is used per layer 
-html compatible components (text, images, label buttons...)

Example provided !!!

This plugin is provided with an example publication named "test_seo_plugin" so you can easily try this functionality.


********************
**  Installation  **
