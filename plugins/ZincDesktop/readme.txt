********************
**  Installation  **
********************

To install this plugin on a silex server, use the manager's plugin installer (exchange platform), or copy the snapshot plugin folder in the silex_server/plugins folder.

********************
**  Activation    **
********************

Server activation (for all publications):
In the server's manager go to "Settings > Plugins > Activate a plugin", click on the plugin icon and then on "confirm".

Specific publication activation:
In the server's manager go to "Manage", click on the publication on which the plugin should be activated, then click on "Plugins > Activate a plugin", and finally click on the plugin icon and then on "confirm".

********************
**  Use           **
********************

* Make a desktop application out of a Silex site *

Download and start Silex portable app. In the Silex portable app folder, there is several folders, such as "silex_server/" and "silex_design_kit/". And there is the Silex launcher application for mac (silex.app), windows (silex.exe) and linux (silex).

Install and activate the plugin for your site in your Silex server. Then duplicate the applications (for mac, windows and linux) and rename them with the name of your site.

When you start the new application, you will see a standard native window with your site in it.

* Use Zink desktop API in your application *

In your Silex site, you can put Silex action on the components and access Zinc API to manipulate files, install programs, install drivers, call system scripts, etc.

For example, this starts a windows script :

onRelease _global.mdm.System.exec:test-script.bat

And for mac

onRelease _global.mdm.System.exec:test-script.sh

Please look at the site "portable-app" provided with Silex portable app version
